# silvuss thoughts in plain CSS

This repository contains a snapshot of the "silvuss thoughts" website from 2018 Aug 1 (back then named "silvuss's thoughts") built with plain [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS). The snapshot looks the same as the original website in the time that it was taken (you can view it here: https://silvuss.github.io/silvuss-thoughts-plain-css/).

This README.md file is different than the original one.
