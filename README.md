# silvuss-thoughts-plain-css

this repository contains a snapshot of the "silvuss thoughts" website from 2018 aug 01 (back then named "silvuss's thoughts") built with plain [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS). the snapshot looks the same as the original website in the time that it was taken (you can view it here: https://silvuss.github.io/silvuss-thoughts-plain-css/).

this README.md file is different than the original one.

## copyright note

note that this "silvuss-thoughts-plain-css" (this project) has **currently no license**, as explained here: https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/.

for your convenience I am including below a quote from that site:
> When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under exclusive copyright by default. Unless you include a license that specifies otherwise, nobody else can use, copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation. Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright holder), “nobody” starts including you.

also note that I can **add a lincese** in the near future if it would be relevant to the needs of this project.

## how this version of the website differs from the original one

this version uses plain [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) (version 3).

## will files in this repository be updated?

this repository is going to show what I have learned in CSS by the time that it was published, so it is not supposed to be updated.
