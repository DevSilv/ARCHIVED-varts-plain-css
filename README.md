# FAQ

## is this a blog?

it may be a blog for you if you want to, but i do not consider it a blog. i would name it "a place for my thoughts" or similar. but, i generally treat it as a blog, when comparing to other blogs.

## but you also call it sometimes "a project"?

yes, because this place has been created as a project in the sense of programming, and in the same sense is maintaned.

## why you do not start sentences with capital letters?

here (and possibly in every github project of mine) i use a convention of not using capital letters beside acronyms (e.g. MS, VCS). for more details, see [this section on a github's wiki of mine](https://github.com/silvuss/silvuss-jsgame-1/wiki/conventions-that-you-should-use-in-this-project#text-writing-and-formatting-conventions-that-you-should-use-in-this-project).

## in the beginning of your posts, beside the creation date, i saw a version number. what is it?

beside the creation date, every post of mine is assigned a version number. it is created according to a convention called [**semantic versioning**](https://semver.org/).

for more details on how i have chosen to use versions, see [versioning system on this blog](https://github.com/silvuss/silvuss-thoughts/versioning.md).

## i have noticed that the content of ayour post that i read earlier has changed. why?

when bloggers have got some new ideas on the subject of an article they have already written and publicized, they usually have three ways to handle this:
- not to do anything (forget about their thoghts);
- write a new post (maybe somehow linked to the old one) â€“ maybe even make a series;
- modify the old post.

**i have chosen to use the last one as a main technique in my posts.** but, sometimes it is useful to see the earlier version of a particular post. so, it is very helpful that github (where this content is hosted) provide the functionality of looking into a file's changelog. therefore, if you want to see it, look at the commit history of [this project repository on github](https://github.com/silvuss/silvuss-thoughts).

## where is it hosted?

it is hosted on github: [this project](https://github.com/silvuss/silvuss-thoughts).
