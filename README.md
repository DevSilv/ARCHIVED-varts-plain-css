# silvuss-thoughts

this project contains my (silvuss's) thoughts on programming, and maybe some other topics. any further details you can find in the FAQ below.

## FAQ

### is this a blog?

you may call this place a blog if you want to, but i do not consider it as such. i would name it "a place for my thoughts" or similar. but i will always use terms that are usually used in the context of blogs, such as "posts" and "articles". and additionaly, i will treat it just as a blog, when i will be comparing it to other blogs.

### but you also call it sometimes "a project"?

yes. i call it so because this place has been created as a project in the sense of programming. in the same sense i maintain it now.

### why you do not start sentences with capital letters?

here (and possibly in every github project of mine) i use a convention of not using capital letters beside acronyms (e.g. MS, VCS). for more details, see [this section on a github's wiki of mine](https://github.com/silvuss/silvuss-jsgame-1/wiki/conventions-that-you-should-use-in-this-project#text-writing-and-formatting-conventions-that-you-should-use-in-this-project).

### in the beginning of your posts i saw a version number. what is it?

every post of mine is assigned a version number. it is created according to a convention called [**semantic versioning**](https://semver.org/).

for more details on how i have chosen to use versions, see [the versioning system of my articles](https://silvuss.github.io/2018/07/10/my-versioning-system.html).

### i have noticed that the content of your post which i read earlier has changed. why?

when bloggers have got some new ideas on the subject of an article they have already written and publicized, they usually have three ways to handle this:
- not to do anything (forget about their thoghts);
- write a new post (maybe somehow linked to the old one) â€“ maybe even make a series;
- modify the old post.

**i have chosen to use the last one as a main technique in my posts.** but, sometimes it is useful to see the earlier version of a particular post. so, it is very helpful that github (where this content is hosted) provides the functionality of looking into a file's changelog. and therefore, if you want to see it, look at the commit history of this project.
