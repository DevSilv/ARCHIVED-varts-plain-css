# silvuss-thoughts-plain-css

This repository contains a snapshot of the "silvuss thoughts" website from 2018 Aug 01 (back then named "silvuss's thoughts") built with plain [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS). The snapshot looks the same as the original website in the time that it was taken. You can view it here: https://silvuss.github.io/silvuss-thoughts-plain-css/.

This README.md file is different than the original one.

## Copyright note

Note that this "silvuss-thoughts-plain-css" (this project) has **currently no license**, as explained here: https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/.

For your convenience, I am including below a quote from that site:
> When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under exclusive copyright by default. Unless you include a license that specifies otherwise, nobody else can use, copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation. Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright holder), “nobody” starts including you.

Also note that I can add a lincese in the near future if it would be relevant to the needs of this project.

## How does this version of the website differ from the original one?

This version uses only plain [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) (version 3).

## Will this project be updated?

this repository is going to show what I have learned in CSS by the time that it was published, so it is not supposed to be updated.
