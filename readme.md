## version of this article

it is version 1.0.0.

for more details on how i have chosen to use versions, see [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## introduction

i have written this article, because i read a lot (i thinks so) of articles online, much of them being technical. however, i see that some of them breaks some rules i would like them to hold. consequently, i have decided to verbalize them and write them down.

**you should treat them as my own reflections. i did not use any sources while writing. therefore, there are no links in the text.**

in the tips, i am assuming that **you** are writing **an article**. it will always be read by some **readers**. it may contains **text** and optional **code**. if you provide code, it means for me that you usually split it into **listings**.  the article that you are writing should have **the primary subject** (== the subject), and may have some **secondary subjects**. both you **analyse** or **describe** in the article.

## the tips

### 1. keep the listings short.

if you are not analysing the subject thoroughly, keep the listings short. if you are analysing the subject thoroughly, also try to keep the listings short.

### 2. code, images, videos and links should only illustrate a subject, not describe it.

if code, images, videos, or links seems to describe text, maybe you should split it into more articles. **about the code specifically:** if it is turning out to be more code than text (in the whole article, in letters), then try to reverse the proportions.

### 3. code, images, videos and links should be as difficult as text.

code (or an image, a video, or a link) more difficult than text will make the reader confused; in the opposite, if it is easier than text, it could make the reader wrong.

### 4. examples should speak for themselves.

if you provide examples, try to keep them accurate – and if you cannot, tell the reader about it. a poor example **with** an indication that it is poor is better than no example. even more, no example is better than a poor example **without** an indication that it is poor.

### 3. the readers should try to understand the subject, not the article.

simple problems described in a complex way become complex. always write simple, clear, and short sentences – no matter that you are either describing the basics, or an advanced topic.

### 4. write short sentences.

in general, the more sentences and compound nouns shorter, the better, because of the real usefulness of it for someone with poor skills in the english language or someone tired for any reason, or someone just not enjoying to read from, for example, a screen; otherwise, the problems of understanding the sentence and finding the verb will appear.

### 5. if you describe several issues, mind the proportions.

if the article discusses several issues of the main subject, try to keep proportions in the length of their descriptions. for example, if the first and the second issue are described in one paragraph each, try to include the third and fourth in no more than three each. otherwise, some issues may seem to be more important, just because you described it in a more extensive way.

### 6. choose the words that you already use.

the article you are writing is not a chapter of a novel. keep the words meanings adequate to the domain that the subject you are writing about is from. it is better to repeat a word four times, than to provide four different words instead, each describing the same concept (remember about non-english readers, who do not have a wide range of vocabulary).

### 7. be consistent when telling the reader what is right.

if the first paragraph tells the reader "you should do X", and the latter "you have to do X", the reader will be **confused**. in the opposite case, if first comes "you have to", and then "you should", the reader will be **mistaken**.

### 8. the reader is out-of-date.

if the article describes a subject considered as up-to-date or not, or something changing fast, e.g. a library (or even one version of it), then:
    - inform the reader about the version you describe;
    - inform the reader whether this version is up-to-date. make it clear if it is not.

### 9. the reader knows only the basics.

if you have to assume that the reader has any advanced knowledge about the subject, mention it in the introduction (so that anybody who do not have the knowledge may exit early). otherwise, assume it knows only the basics.

### 10. the reader reads only your article.

inform the reader whether the subject is already widely described (in internet, in books, and the like) and summarize it. if it would be too much information, provide links.

### 11. code rarely speaks for itself. images rarely speak for themselves. videos rarely speak for themselves. links rarely speak for themselves.

if you do not provide a description, the reader may lost the context. always provide an explanation for a listing, an image, a video, and a link, if it helps understand the subject (even as a more extensive comment or caption). generally, if it is not a description, but you used it instead of text, it probably need one.

### 12. enumerate cautiously.

if you write "firstly", do not change the "secondly" for "next" or "later" – otherwise the reader will get lost. if it is turning out to be more than three points, enumerate them by numbers (preferably starting from a new line).
