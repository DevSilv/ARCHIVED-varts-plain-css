when it comes about AI, it is almost always said that it is still being improved. of course, there are usually reasons given (and usually implicitly) why it has to be improved – for better security, safety or usability.

but yesterday a thought came to my mind: what does "improved" exactly mean? as it is never explained, is it really not confusing?

since AI means intelligence that is "artificial", i understand it at first as "made by humans". but still it is not clear what does it mean that something made by us "can be improved", or "is being improved" or "is improved".

so, since "to improve a thing" means "to make a thing as good as something", we can make further distinction:

1. do we ("the creators") want the AI to be as good as ourselves, or
2. do we want it to be as good as it can be?

these two cases are indeed separate because, maybe a bit unintuitively, we, humans, do not have to be "the best" (i hope you all agree with me, according to the logic). but there, an obvious question comes to mind: what does it mean "to be good" (and "to be the best")?

i have answered this myself and this is my definition:

_when a thing made by someone (the creator) is good, it means that it meets the requirements that its creator is expected to make his thing to meet, or expects the thing to meet._

so, let us go back to the AI: is that enough that we know that there are some requirements which must be met, so that AI will be improved?

possibly not enough – specifically then, when we want to make it clear what we are doing. maybe some of the requirements are harmful will have harmful effects for some of us?

therefore, there comes another question to mind: are they adequate to the context?

by "context", i mean the following five things:
1. "what" – who is required (the subject)?
2. "who" – who is requiring (the object)?
3. "when" – in what situation will a requirement be effective?
4. "where" – in what domain will a requirement be effective? (by a domain i mean also: a field, a discipline)
5. "what for" – what a requirement should be met for?

by "adequate", i mean the following five things:
1. the subject is objectively (that is, not just in someone's opinion) not against the requirement in the current context (that is, the rest of these points).
2. the object can require in the current context.
3. the situation cannot (not just: does not) have two requirements that are in contradiction in the current context.
4. the domain cannot (not just: does not) have two requirements that are in contradiction in the current context.
5. one can give at least one reason what is a requirement for in the current context.

taken all that ten points, we can (probably) say with little doubt what does it mean "to improve" something. so let us look back for a while to the two questions from the beginning:

1. do we ("the creators") want the AI to be as good as ourselves, or
2. do we want it to be as good as it can be?

i think we can now understand these questions a little better. but, still i think it is a field of consideration how to answer them and maybe a good subject for an article in the future.
